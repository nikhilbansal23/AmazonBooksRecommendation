Amazon Books Recommendation System

Description:
The Amazon Books Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized book recommendations to users based on their preferences. It utilizes book metadata such as titles, authors, genres, prices, ratings, and the number of people who rated the books to generate recommendations. The system employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze book titles and extract features for recommendation.

Model Explanation:

-  Data Preprocessing: The system preprocesses the book data, including cleaning, transforming, and combining relevant features. This ensures consistency and usability in the recommendation process.

-  Feature Extraction: Features such as book titles, authors, and genres are extracted and combined to create a comprehensive representation of each book. For example, the combined features might include both the title and genre of the book.

-  Similarity Calculation: Using techniques like cosine similarity, the system calculates the similarity between books based on their combined features. This allows it to identify books that are similar to the ones a user likes.

-  Recommendation Generation: When a user provides input (either a book title or free text), the system first checks for an exact match in the database. If no exact match is found, it utilizes fuzzy string matching to find close matches. Then, it retrieves the top similar books based on the calculated similarity scores and other criteria such as rating and popularity.

-  Output: The system provides the user with a list of recommended book titles along with their combined genres. This allows users to explore books that align with their interests and preferences.
